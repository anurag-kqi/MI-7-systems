School Management System :

*CLIENT-SERVER Architecture

Client-server architecture for school Management system architecture of a computer network
in which many clients (remote processes) request and receive service from a centralized
server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to
request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. Server waits
for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them.
Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients
need not be aware of the specifics of the system that
is providing the service. Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers,
while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines.

In school management syetem data processing, for example,
a client computer can be running an application program for student information while the
server computer is running another program that manages the database in which the information
is permanently stored.Many clients can access the server’s information simultaneously, and, at
the same time, a client computer can perform other tasks, such as sending e-mail. Because both
client and server computers are considered intelligent devices, the client-server model is
completely different from the old “mainframe” model, in which a centralized mainframe computer
performed all.

Server side code will look like following:
    - read opertion: What operation to perform
    - based on the operation value, server knows if it needs more data from client or not. If more data needed, read the extra data from client.
    - perform the operations
    - write the result data back to client

Client side code will look like following:
    - menu taking input
    - write to server what operation to perform
    - write to server any extra data needed for the operation
    - wait for the data from server
    - display the data
    - wait in the menu
