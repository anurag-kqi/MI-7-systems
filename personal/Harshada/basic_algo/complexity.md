Complexity of Algorithm:
  - It is a measure to count the number of operation/iteration performed by the Algorithm.
  - Simplay, Complexity is rough aporximation of the number of stapes required to exicute an Algorithm (depends on the size of the data).
  - Commonly represented as the 'O(f)' (Big O notation)
      - f is the function of the size of the data

Types:
  1. Constant [ O(1) ]
  2. Logarithamic [ O(log(N)) ]
  3. Linear [ O(N) ]
  4. Quadratic [ O(N^2) ]
  5. Cubic [ O(N^3) ]
  6. Exponentioal [ O(2^n, O(N!), O(n^k)) ]
  7. n*log(n)
