coding style:
1. Tab and spaces:
    - never mix tabs and spaces
    - use atom setting of soft tab, set tab to 4 spaces
    - use (CtrShiftP and convert all tabs to spaces) to convert existing
        tabs to 4 spaces
    - and going forward only spaces
    - use atom preference->editor settings to show invisible to seen   
        the spaces, code must not have tabs

2. Code must be indented properly
