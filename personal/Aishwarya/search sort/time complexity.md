1. Bubble Sort:
        i. Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). 
                Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
        ii. Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). 
                Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

2. Quick Sort: 
        i. Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n*n)
                The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot.
        ii. Best Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn).
                The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot.

3. Binary Search:
        i. Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(log2n). 
                A searching algorithm requires maximum number of comparisons in unsuccessful search.
        ii. Best Case Time Complexity: O(1). 
                Algorithm will need just 1 comarision if the element is fount at the center.
