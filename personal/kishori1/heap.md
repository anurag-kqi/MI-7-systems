1. What is heap sort?
* Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. 
* It is similar to selection sort.
* First find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. 
* Repeat the same process for remaining element.

2.What is binary heap?
* A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order
* such that value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. 
* The former is called as max heap and the latter is called min-heap. 
* The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.
* time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).

3. what is insertion sort?
* The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
* Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
* Time Complexity: O(n*2)
