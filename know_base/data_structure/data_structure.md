Basic data structures:

1. How does binary search work?
- Aishu: 

1a. What is the meaning of time complexity of a program?
- Objective: You want to find how good or bad an algo is? Basically, how do you compare
    different algo. 
- time complexity is never measured in the time unit (sec, msec), in terms of number of operation performed
- for given N elements, how many operations that algo is going to perform 
    time complexity

1b. Why time taken by a program is not a good measure for how good or bad an algo is?
- time taken by a program will depend on following:
    - number of elements (size of the problem)
    - number of comparison (how algo is working)
    - how fast is your processor
- that is the reason, time taken by program is not a good measure for the comparing algo


2. What is the time complexity of binary search?

3. Give couple of sorting methods?

4. Write code the bubble sort?

5. Write code for quick sort?

6. What is Binary search tree?

7. What is AVL tree?

8. What is hash table?

9. When will you use hash table over tree or vice-versa?
